# Genetic Algorithm Implementation

This project implements a genetic algorithm to solve optimization problems. The code includes various methods for selection, crossover, and mutation, allowing for a flexible approach to finding solutions.

## Features

- **Selection Methods**: 
  - Canonical Selection
  - Rank-Based Selection
  - Tournament Selection
  - Roulette-Wheel Selection

- **Crossover Methods**:
  - Single Point Crossover
  - Two Point Crossover
  - Multi Point Crossover
  - Uniform Crossover
  - Uniform Crossover with Mask
  - Half Uniform Crossover
  - Three Parent Crossover

- **Mutation Methods**:
  - Mutation Flipping
  - Mutation Interchanging
  - Mutation Reversing
  - Gene Inversion Mutation
